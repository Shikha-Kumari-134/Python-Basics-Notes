# Python Basics Notes
Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its readability and simplicity. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming. Python's extensive standard library and vibrant community make it a popular choice for web development, data analysis, artificial intelligence, and more.
